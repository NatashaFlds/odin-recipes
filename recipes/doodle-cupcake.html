        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 cupcake cups with liners.</li>
            <li>Mix together 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon for cupcakes in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, salt, and baking soda in another bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Cream together butter and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in egg 
                and vanilla and mix an additional 2 minutes. Pour in half of the flour mixture and mix until just combined. 
                Pour in buttermilk and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tablespoon of batter in the bottom of each cupcake liner. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon-sugar 
                over the batter. Add another heaped 1 tablespoon of batter on top. Sprinkle with an additional 1/2 teaspoon 
                cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat layering in each cupcake liner.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes spring back lightly when touched, 24 to 28 minutes. Allow to cool 
                for several minutes in the pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>For the frosting: Beat butter on high speed until lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Add in powdered sugar 
                1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Add in heavy cream and 
                beat until frosting is light and fluffy, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Frost cooled cupcakes as desired.</li>
        </ol>
